Removes influence cost when draining 90% of sector resources.
For any Stellaris verison, compatible with all other mods, disables acheivements.

This allows balancing resources freely between empire and sectors.
Making one more step towards having sectors as useful things, and not some kind of punishment, tax, limitation or an extra frustrating micromanagement "Trick the Sector AI" minigame.

75% -> 90% drain-per-click increase is to avoid having to click the button multiple times, yet still leave last scraps for sector maintenance in case of deficit.
Note that you can immediately put some of the stuff back as necessary, since there is no tax on moving it in either direction.

AI should also drain its sectors for free, but afaik only does so when they are quite rich, i.e. rarely.

Does not override files, only updates two define parameters, so won't conflict with anything except mods doing exactly same thing (like [url=steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1270665185]Smaller Sector Drain[/url] for example).

To go further towards useful sectors by making them much smarter, I'd recommend using [url=steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1140543652]Glavius's Ultimate AI Megamod[/url]. It's really good for AI empires too.
