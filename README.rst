Misc game-related tweaks and tools that I tend to write
-------------------------------------------------------

Just a collection of accumulated stuff in no particular order, to be able to
link or remember stuff occasionally.

Scripts here pretty much always have some -h/--help option/output, with
purpose/usage and all options documented there, as tend to write these down to
avoid forgetting them myself.

Likely to be out of date to a various degree for most games/mods that get updates.

`Stellaris`_
------------

Sometimes needs a bunch of fixes and/or balancing tweaks for whatever weird and
unexpected game scenario you end up with, though extra content mods are nice too.

Mods are for post-2.0 era.

- `Fast Cyborg Assimilation
  <https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1322434314>`_

  Cybernetic assimilation mechanics were clearly developed for either gestalt
  consciousness empires which have no politics, or egalitarian ones that have
  all species rights granted by default.

  Don't work well for authoritarian/xenophobe slavers, as this sets all
  assimilating pops "free" for a long time, and keep resetting rights for
  assimilated pops to "full citizenship" for no good reason.

  Simple workaround implemented in this mod is to make process fast enough to be
  less painful - more of a quick disruption than decades-long PITA.

- `Strike Craft as Fleet Support
  <https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1372641051>`_

  Rebalance mod for strike craft in Stellaris 2.0, making them into general
  "jack of all trades, master of none" fleet support weapon, good against all
  ship types without straight-up countering anything.

- `Microwarpdrives
  <https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1376483538>`_

  Adds technology and ship module similar to MWDs in EVE Online - hypercharged
  afterburners that have some combat penalties at the expense of even higher speed.

  Here they're mostly for logistical purposes - redeploy support ships faster
  between starbases or chase down pirates with an overwhelming fleet of lighter ships.

- `Glavius AI Sector Development Edicts
  <https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1380893289>`_

  Tweak for `Glavius's Ultimate AI Megamod
  <https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1140543652>`_ to allow
  more control over some annoying Sector AI decisions via empire/planetary edicts.

- `Free Sector Resource Drain
  <https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1372032752>`_

  Another simple (and likely temporary) tweak to fix weird cost on clicking
  "transfer resources" button for AI-managed sectors, making them less of a nuisance.

- `Tech Tier Numbers on Laser Icons
  <https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1383042040>`_

  Also a tiny graphics fix for tech icons on one branch missing proper tech tier identifiers.

- `Shadowrun Name List
  <https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1363348791>`_

  Extensive Name List from The Sixth World of Shadowrun cyberpunk dystopia universe.

  | Pulled/generated by scripts from shadowrun.itemcards.com name generator.
  | Scripts are in the repo alongside resulting list.

- track-mod-changes.py

  Script to run before starting Steam to track changes in all subscribed and local mods.

  Useful to spot recent mod changes that can potentially break the game or might
  be the cause for whatever weirdness suddenly happening there, as well as
  tracking whether these get up-to-date with the mainline patches.

- combine-music-packs.py

  Script to parse all .asset/.txt/.yml files in music mods and combine all
  tracks from these into one mod, with track names having "mod-name :: title"
  format in in-game player.

  Using that with hundreds of tracks from mods will break in-game music player,
  as it turns out (will render overflow as blank playlist) - definitely not
  designed for that many :)

`Factorio`_
-----------

Great game, but found large-scale production required in late-game a bit too
slow or tedious to setup or debug without bunch of repetition.

Easy to fix with mods though, which are one of the best parts of the game.

- `Burner Drill 4x4 Area
  <https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Burner_Drill_4x4_Area>`_

  Changes Burner Mining Drills to have 4x4 resource search area instead of
  default 2x2 (right under), and nothing else.

- `Will-o'-the-Wisps updated
  <https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Will-o-the-Wisps_updated>`_

  Compatibility update (for Factorio 0.16.x) and bunch of tweaks to
  `Will-o'-the-Wisps mod <https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Will-o-the-wisps>`_
  by Betep3akata, which seem to be abandoned since 0.15.x.
  License: `CC BY-NC-SA <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode>`_

- `Vehicle Cruise Control
  <https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Vehicle_Cruise_Control>`_

  Adds GUI panel with buttons to toggle acceleration and brakes, so that you
  don't have to hold W or S.

- ReducedResearchX

  Local mod to reduce all research costs by somewhat complicated formula,
  designed to keep early-game tech costs pretty-much as-is, but have massive
  reductions for late-game techs.

  Formula (python3 notation): ``cost = lambda v: (a + max(0,v-a)*b**(v/(v+c)))``

  Chart for what costs end up being can be checked in `doc/research-cost-chart.html
  <https://mk-fg.github.io/games/factorio/ReducedResearchX/doc/research-cost-chart.html>`_

  Shows how late-game techs that cost 1k/2k/5k research units get down to
  ~300/500/1k, while early-game ones get much smaller to no reductions.

  | Does not change research time by default, as it's not a bottleneck anyway.
  | Based on simple "ReducedResearch" mod (~10 lines of lua), but with updated formula.

- mod-list.yaml - list of mods from when I last played (should include base game
  version number) and backed it up.

- blueprints.yaml - misc blueprints I came up with, esp. for defence units or
  stuff like circuit logic parts.

Useful companion links for the game:

- https://doomeer.com/factorio/ - production chain calculator, simpliest.
- https://rubyruy.github.io/factorio-calc/ - same as above, but found it harder to use.
- https://dddgamer.github.io/factorio-cheat-sheet/ - good cheatsheet for numbers/ratios.

Best use for production chain calculators (that I've found) is to know in
advance how much basic resources (like copper and steel) to put into main belts
for some desired output level, and how many assemblers/throughput it'd require.

`Surviving Mars`_
-----------------

Great sci-fi city builder, like Outpost games of old, but with much lighter tone, and on Mars.

Minor quality-of-life lua tweaks for early versions:

- `cheaper-consumer-items <https://www.nexusmods.com/survivingmars/mods/4>`_

  70% cheaper Art and Electronics shop consumables for crowded domes, as they
  really slow production down needlessly otherwise.

- `no-border-scrolling <https://www.nexusmods.com/survivingmars/mods/5>`_

  For some reason it's extremely sensitive and annoying here, though maybe
  because I tend to move cursor from the window to tweak more lua too often.

- `university-entrance-exams <https://www.nexusmods.com/survivingmars/mods/6>`_

  Bars mentally challenged colonists from studying in Martian University,
  leaving them in service jobs forever, where they can do relatively little harm.

- `geologist-uniform-recolor <https://www.nexusmods.com/survivingmars/mods/15>`_

  Changes uniform color on all Geologist icons from same Sahara Yellow to an
  unique Spring Green, to be distinct from Engineers and Botanists.

  Really hard to tell icons for these apart otherwise, such a weird UI choice.

- `full-uniform-recolor <https://www.nexusmods.com/survivingmars/mods/15>`_

  Optional version of geologist-uniform-recolor mod above,
  with few other color tweaks to make icons even more distinctive.

- polymers-production-buff

  Alternative to "cheaper-consumer-items" hack to just boost a-bit-too-slow
  resource production on that sanity-breaking outdoors factory instead.

- `console.lua <surviving-mars/console.lua>`_

  Adds in-game lua testing and introspection console.

  Has built-in docs, and created mostly to dump info on any selected /
  around-cursor objects (in json/text formats) or test arbitrary lua calls.

`Darkest Dungeon`_: darkest-dungeon-save-manager.py
---------------------------------------------------

Cheat tool to backup DD save games, as it's too hardcore, random-bs and grindy
for my tastes.

So simple fix is just to allow some (minor) save-scumming, which is what this
tool does - allows to copy saved game state to multiple slots, like with any
less hardcore game.

Usage::

  % ./darkest-dungeon-sm save
  % ./darkest-dungeon-sm save some-slot-name

  % ./darkest-dungeon-sm list
  % ./darkest-dungeon-sm   # same thing

  % ./darkest-dungeon-sm restore   # latest slot
  % ./darkest-dungeon-sm restore some-slot-name
  % ./darkest-dungeon-sm restore any-name-part
  % ./darkest-dungeon-sm restore .5.

  % ./darkest-dungeon-sm remove -n10   # show 10 oldest slots to cleanup
  % ./darkest-dungeon-sm remove -n10 -x   # actually remove stuff

Remove some tension from the game for sure, if you know that the save is not
that far-off, but at least it's playable that way.

`Satellite Reign`_: sat-reign-pick-clone.py
-------------------------------------------

Simple script to find clone id in savegame xml by specified parameters.

Mostly cosmetic thing - allows to transplant some game-important parameters into
clone/agent with specific appearance, which was (maybe still is) cool because
there are all sorts of fancy cyberpunk character models in that game, but you
can't switch these for agents without sacrificing stats.

Usage:

- Pick whatever clone you want to use ingame, remember their stats.

- Run tool to find id of that clone in savegame by stats::

    ./sat-reign-pick-clone.py 'h: 5, s: 9, hr: 0.05, e: 0, er: 0' sr_save.xml

- Find that id in xml, paste stats from current (up-to-date) agent clone into
  weak clone with that id and appearance, so it'd be viable to use.

- Load game and swap agent into that clone.

`Anno 2070`_
------------

City layouts and production chains, as that's pretty much all there is in that
game, plus pretty graphics ofc.

- layout-\*.png

  | City layout templates, probably nicked from wikia.
  | For early techs this is kinda important, as costs are quite high there.
  | Usually use large corridor layout for sprawling non-tech cities.

- production-chains-best.{png,xcf}

  Production chain ratios, space requirements (production "field" count/size),
  and numbers for how much demand they satisfy, as getting them right through
  trial and error is very wasteful and hard to remember them all.

.. _Anno 2070: http://anno2070.wikia.com/


`Kerbal Space Program`_ (ksp)
-----------------------------

Bunch of delta-V and aerobraking maps, along with some outdated mod tweaks.

.. _Kerbal Space Program: https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/


`OpenXCOM XPirateZ mod`_
------------------------

Very extensive total conversion for OpenXCOM, and one of the best turn-based
strategies out there if complexity and longevity is your thing.

Fair warning though - art/text in that mod can get weird.

- piratez-melee-calc.py

  Curses (console) tool to examine/compare stats per TU and various buffs for
  hundreds of weapons that are in that mod, which are not particulary well-documented.

  Example run::

    % ./piratez-melee-calc.py -a -c ruleset_099F5.yaml.cache.json
      x:Ax 'Ball Bat' Saber Shiv Handle x:Dagger Rope x:Pipe Cutlass
      Fistycuffs Handy Shovel Machete Billhook Cattle 'Leather Whip'
      x:Spear 'Spiked Mace' Barbaric Barbed Rapier 'Fuso Sword'

  Curses UI::

     strength: 33  melee: 70  throwing: 40  time: 65  bravery: 40   >>

  Main field is "dpu" - Damage per TU - which is calculated as "damage-per-hit *
  accuracy / TU" for melee weapons, with no accuracy multiplier for ranged.

  Also shows all special effects in addition to that, allowing to easily pick
  something good for specific purpose, taking specific soldier's attributes into
  account (input on top).

  piratez-extract-rulesets.sh is a helper script to run ``piratez-melee-calc.py
  -c`` and cache all the stuff from multiple YAML sources so that these will be
  parsed much faster from there, and there'll be no need to specify all of them on
  each run (as cache-file contains all the info).

  piratez-melee-calc.json next to the script is a sample cache file with
  probably quite out-of-date stats, extracted from some old-ish mod version.

- `piratez-melee-calc.html
  <https://mk-fg.github.io/games/openxcom/piratez-melee-calc.html>`_

  Straight-up translation of the calculator script above to JS/D3-based
  in-browser tool.

  Can be used with json cache file comitted in the repo via link above,
  otherwise just put both html and json into same path and run html via browser.

Misc Scripts
------------

Helper scripts not related to specific games.

- gog-unpack.sh

  Script to unpack GoG (gog.com) linux archives without running makeself and
  mojosetup.

  They seem to have ``[ N lines of makeself script ] || mojosetup.tar.gz ||
  game.zip`` format, and script creates \*.mojosetup.tar.gz and \*.zip in the
  current directory from specified .sh pack, using only grep/head/tail coreutils.

  Usage: ``./gog-unpack.sh /path/to/gog-game.sh``

  Note that zip can have configuration and post-install instructions for
  mojosetup in it (under "scripts/"), plus misc assets like icons and such.
