This mod adds on/off switch button for sending a single circuit network signal.

Mod Settings (startup):

- Toggle On/Off on click

    **Checked**: Will change On/Off state on left-click, will open signal panel with the assigned keybind.
    **Unchecked**: Left-click will work normally like with a regular constant combinator, hotkey will toggle On/Off state.

- Show signal in Alt-info mode

    **Checked**: Display configured signal overlay when switch is enabled in Alt-info mode, like constant combinator does.
    **Unchecked**: Do not display signal in Alt-info mode.

Mod hotkey - "Switch Button keybind" - allows to either open switch inventory or to toggle it, depending on "Toggle On/Off on click" mod option described above.

Based on [the original Switch_Button mod](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Switch_Button) by GalactusX31, with some minor bugfixes and updated for compatibility with Factorio 1.0.
