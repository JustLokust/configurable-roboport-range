Version: 0.0.12
Date: 2020-09-04
  Changes:
    - Replace combinator type/looks from 1x1 to 2x1 one, with separate inputs and outputs.
      All existing old combinators from saved games will be removed on migration,
      but their non-duplicate/empty code is stored on spare preset buttons, with notification about it.
    - Currently combinator looks exactly like arithmetic one, need to update sprites/icons/thumbnails.
    - Improve help text for various unclear things that were reported.
    - Display output signals in the GUI, but separately from inputs.
    - Pressing Esc (or default "close guis") key now unfocuses code textbox first, closes on second press.

    - Fix wrong line being highlighted for lua errors with leading empty lines.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.0.9
Date: 2020-09-04

Version: 0.0.2
Date: 2020-09-02
  Features:
    - Remove separate input/output things and 2x1 combinator variant,
      not sure what's a good use-case for these.
    - Add "debug" flag to dump combinator code inputs/outputs to factorio log.
    - Misfeature: multiplayer is probably broken, not sure if worked before,
      with a bunch of local state assigned on ticks.

  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed closing GUI on Esc key.

  Changes:
    - Major control code rewrite, ~600 less lines of stuff, but likely with a lot of new bugs, unfortunately.
    - Code environment changes - rednet -> red, geennet -> green, output -> out, all return 0 for missing keys, etc.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.0.1
Date: 2020-08-31
  Features:
    - Initial release, based on IWTDU's Sandboxed LuaCombinator mod code
      (which in turn is based on OwnlyMe's LuaCombinator2), but with less features.

  Changes:
    - Remove all auto-indentation and syntax highlighting -
      it's not a substitute for vim/emacs, just paste/tweak code there.
    - Remove all blueprint serialization code - one of these can easily control everything in the game,
      use simplier combinators for basic arithmetic.
    - GUIs have fixed position, not bouncing somewhere around screen center, and are generally fixed-up a bit.
