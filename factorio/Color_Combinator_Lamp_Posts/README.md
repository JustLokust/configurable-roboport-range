It's just a small power-efficient lamp post with a built-in combinator for an easy color selection (opens on click).
Can be used for decoration, as a simple marker for specific places, circuit network signal indicator, or a single-slot constant combinator.

Known limitation: blueprints won't store color and just place default white lights - signal serialization for them is not implemented.
