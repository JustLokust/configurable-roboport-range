--------------------

## Description

Makes trees on Nauvis self-ignite sometimes.

This is balanced to check large areas for burnt vs green trees and not just burn everything down over time.
Probably not well-balanced though, as it's a relatively new mod, so feel free to test it and leave a comment.

Settings in this mod can change between versions for balancing reasons, so that old defaults don't stick.


--------------------

## How to test and tune balance (for those who want to tweak it)

Hover over Mod Settings (startup tab) - all intervals and checks done are described there.

Also check out "/wf" console command (run it to get more info), which allows to test-run various checks, starting fires or tagging locations on the map, as well as printing various stats that are relevant for wildfire checks.
