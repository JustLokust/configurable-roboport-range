Wildfire=Makes trees self-ignite sometimes, but balanced not to burn the whole map.

[mod-setting-description]

wf-spark-interval=Interval between starting checks for wildfire sparks in factorio ticks (60 ticks = 1s at 1x speed).
wf-spark-interval-jitter=Random value to add/subtract from spark interval, picked each time between 0 and this value (in factorio ticks).

wf-check-interval=Interval between picking wildfire location when fire should start, in factorio ticks.\nEach time random location is picked and checked if fire should be started there.\nThese checks are repeated until either suitable location is found or check count limit.
wf-check-radius=Radius to check trees in around randomly-picked location, for whether it's suitable for starting a fire there.
wf-check-limit=Max random locations to pick and check for suitability (until one is found or this limit) within each spark interval.

wf-min-green-trees=Min green (non-dead) trees within checked area for it to be suitable to start a wildfire.
wf-max-dead-trees=Max dead (burnt or pollution-killed) trees within checked area to be suitable to start a wildfire. Idea is to skip areas (near) where fires already happened.
wf-green-dead-balance=Ratio of alive to dead trees to make area suitable for starting a wildfire. E.g. 20 = there have to be 20 alive trees to each dead one in the area.
