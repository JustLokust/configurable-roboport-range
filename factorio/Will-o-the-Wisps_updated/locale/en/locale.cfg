[item-description]
wisp-yellow=Live in forests and aren't generally aggressive.
wisp-purple=Will-o'-wisp in the state of spore. Cause corrosion of structures around them and have devastating effect on power infrastructure.
wisp-red=Live under stones. Physical damage leads to fast replication process.
UV-lamp=Reduces lifetime of purple will-o'-the-wisps at night, affects other wisps as well. 12-tile radius.
wisp-detector=Reports counts of wisps within detection range, which can be controlled by R signal (default=16 tiles, max=128).
wisp-drone-blue=Pet UV-resistant wisp with especially bright glow and long lifespan, but extremely underwhelming attack.
wisp-drone-blue-capsule=Pet UV-resistant wisp with especially bright glow and long lifespan, but extremely underwhelming attack to use as a personal lantern.

[mod-setting-description]

wisps-can-attack=When disabled, will-o'-wisps will never attack, even if killed. Wisp spores will still corrode stuff around them when passing by though.
wisp-death-retaliation-radius=Radius around killed wisp, in which wisps retaliate against player aggression. Setting it to 0 will mean "whole map".
defences-shoot-wisps=When disabled, wisps will not be targeted by defences like turrets or player, unless they are on the offensive. Though they can always be force-targeted manually (C key), attacked by explosives or smashed by vehicles.
purple-wisp-damage=When disabled, purple will-o'-the-wisps will drift by harmlessly without causing any cause damage to nearby structures.

wisp-map-spawn-count=Limits total number of active wisps present on the map. Lower values can be used for better game performance.
wisp-map-spawn-pollution-factor=Wisps appear in forested places at night according to "1 + relative-pollution[0-1] * factor" formula, so setting this to 5 will make wisps appear in most polluted areas 6x as likely ("1 + 1*5"), 0 will make chances equal, and e.g. -0.9 will have them spawn largely away from pollution ("1 - 0.9 * [0-1]").

wisp-map-spawn-purple=Chance of spawning specific will-o'-wisp type in random forests at night. Must be in 0-1 range, but can sum up to less than 1 to have wisps spawn less in general, while sum >1 will just use values as weights (i.e. p=y=r=1 same as p=y=r=0.33).
wisp-map-spawn-yellow=Chance of spawning specific will-o'-wisp type in random forests at night. Must be in 0-1 range, but can sum up to less than 1 to have wisps spawn less in general, while sum >1 will just use values as weights (i.e. p=y=r=1 same as p=y=r=0.33).
wisp-map-spawn-red=Chance of spawning specific will-o'-wisp type in random forests at night. Must be in 0-1 range, but can sum up to less than 1 to have wisps spawn less in general, while sum >1 will just use values as weights (i.e. p=y=r=1 same as p=y=r=0.33).
