wisp-yellow=Live in forests and aren't generally aggressive.
wisp-red=Live under stones. Physical damage leads to fast replication process.
wisp-purple=Will-o'-wisp in the state of spore. Cause corrosion of structures around them and have devastating effect on power infrastructure.
UV-lamp=Reduces lifetime of purple will-o'-the-wisps at night, affects other wisps as well. 12-tile radius.
wisp-detector=Reports counts of wisps within detection range, which can be controlled by R signal (default=16 tiles, max=128).

[mod-setting-description]

wisps-can-attack=When disabled, will-o'-wisps will never actively attack, even if provoked. Wisp spores will still corrode stuff around them when passing by though.
defences-shoot-wisps=When disabled, wisps will not be valid target for defences like turrets or player. Though they can still be force-targeted manually (C key), attacked by explosives or smashed by vehicles.
purple-wisp-damage=When disabled, purple will-o'-the-wisps will drift by harmlessly without causing any cause damage to nearby structures.

wisp-map-spawn-count=Limits total number of active wisps present on the map. Lower values can be used for better game performance.
wisp-map-spawn-purple=Chance of spawning specific will-o'-wisp type in random forests at night. Must be in 0-1 range, but can sum up to less than 1 to have wisps spawn less in general, while sum >1 will just use values as weights (i.e. p=y=r=1 same as p=y=r=0.33).
wisp-map-spawn-yellow=Chance of spawning specific will-o'-wisp type in random forests at night. Must be in 0-1 range, but can sum up to less than 1 to have wisps spawn less in general, while sum >1 will just use values as weights (i.e. p=y=r=1 same as p=y=r=0.33).
wisp-map-spawn-red=Chance of spawning specific will-o'-wisp type in random forests at night. Must be in 0-1 range, but can sum up to less than 1 to have wisps spawn less in general, while sum >1 will just use values as weights (i.e. p=y=r=1 same as p=y=r=0.33).
