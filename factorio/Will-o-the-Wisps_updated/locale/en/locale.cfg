[item-description]
wisp-yellow=Yellow will-o'-the-wisps live in forests and do not attack first.
wisp-red=Red will-o'-the-wisps live under stones. Physical damage leads to fast replication process.
wisp-purple=Will-o'-the-wisp in the state of spore. They cause the corrosion of structures around and have a devastating effect on solar power plants.
UV-lamp=UV-light is the only solution to reduce a lifetime of purple will-o'-the-wisps at night. Also affects on other types of the wisps. (Range: 10 tiles)
wisp-detector=The breakthrough in the alien biotechnology made it possible to detect the wisps at a location nearby. (Default range: 16 tiles)

[mod-setting-name]
wisps-can-attack=Wisps can attack
defences-shoot-wisps=Automated defences target wisps
purple-wisp-damage=Purple wisps corrode buildings
dynamic-wisp-lights=Dynamic ghost lights

[mod-setting-description]
wisps-can-attack=When disabled, will-o'-wisps will never actively attack, even if provoked. Wisp spores will still corrode stuff around them when passing by though.
defences-shoot-wisps=When disabled, wisps will not be valid target for defences like turrets or player. Though they can still be force-targeted manually (C key), attacked by explosives or smashed by vehicles.
purple-wisp-damage=When disabled, purple will-o'-the-wisps will drift by harmlessly without causing any cause damage to nearby structures.
dynamic-wisp-lights=Use colored and flickering lights for wisps instead of generic same-size circle. Can be a bit annoying visually.
