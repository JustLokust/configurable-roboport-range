Compatibility update (for Factorio 0.16.x) and tweaks to [Will-o'-the-wisps mod by Betep3akata](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Will-o-the-wisps).


## Description

This mod adds enigmatic Will-o'-the-Wisps to the game, which can be seen around forests at night.

- Yellow Will-o'-Wisp
    - They live in forests and aren't generally aggressive.
    - Destruction of trees at night time will draw them out in droves.
- Red Will-o'-Wisp
    - Rare wisps that live under rocks.
    - Physical damage will split them into multiple ones.
- Purple Will-o'-Wisp
    - Will-o'-the-Wisp spore.
    - Cause corrosion of structures and power infrastructure in particular.

UV light is the only known way to reduce lifespan of purple Will-o'-Wisps at night.
Affects other wisps in different ways as well.


## Hints

- Try not to burn forests at night.
- Trees destroyed or mined at night-time might spawn yellow wisps, rocks - red ones.
- Most production machinery (belts, inserters, assemblers, etc) is not susceptible to corrosion damage from wisps.
- Purple wisps don't touch small electrical poles (as they're made of alien wood), but keep them away from power generation stuff.
- For affected buildings, corrosion resistance is derived from acid resistance.
- If your turrets shoot down a wisp, try to stay away from its kind that night.
- Overlapping UV lights will amplify the effects.
- Wisps are easier to find when wandering through forest after dark.
- Disable turrets targeting wisps in Mod Options menu to coexist with them peacefully.


## Changes from the original mod

- 0.16.x compatibility update and related fixes (events, entity names, etc).
- Fix memory leak on every game/mod changes due to chunk info duplication in save files.
- Adjust UV lamps' electricity usage down 400kW -> 80kW.
- Lower red wisps health significantly (180 -> 30).
- Purple wisps do more damage to boilers/reactors in addition to solar panels.

- Some visual tweaks.
