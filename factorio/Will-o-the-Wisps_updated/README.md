## Description

Adds enigmatic Will-o'-the-Wisps to the game, which can be seen around forests at night.

One current goal of the mod is to add some visible consequences to destroying alien forests or dumping pollution into them, but not necessarily damaging ones (see mod options).
Another one is making alien nature look more alive and mysterious, as nights in particular can look a bit dull there.
Third optional one, also coming from the original mod, is to make long electricity transmission lines or isolated solar farms a bit less of a no-brainer, with wisps damaging or leeching energy off them over time (not fully implemented yet).

New alien fauna:

- Yellow Will-o'-Wisp
    - They live in forests and aren't generally aggressive.
    - Destruction of trees at night time will draw them out in droves.
- Red Will-o'-Wisp
    - Rare wisps that live under rocks.
    - Physical damage will split them into multiple ones.
- Purple Will-o'-Wisp
    - Will-o'-the-Wisp spore.
    - Cause corrosion of structures and power infrastructure in particular.

Technologies:

- UV Lamp (solar energy research) - only known way to reduce lifespan of purple Will-o'-Wisps when it's dark.
- Wisp Detector (alien biotech research) - outputs number of wisps around it to circuit network with a range input.
- Pet Will-o'-Wisp Lantern (combat robots) - lasting UV-resistant wisp drone to use as a personal lantern.


## Hints

- Avoid burning forests at night.
- Trees destroyed or mined at night-time might spawn yellow wisps, rocks - red ones.
- Most production machinery (belts, inserters, assemblers, etc) is not susceptible to corrosion damage from wisps.
- For affected buildings, corrosion resistance is derived from acid resistance.
- Power infrastructure is vulnerable to purple wisps, though not wooden poles.
- If your turrets shoot down a wisp, try to stay away from its kind that night.
- Disable turrets targeting wisps in Mod Options menu to avoid accidental aggression.
- UV will kill wisps without retaliation or replication. Overlapping lamps will amplify effects.
- Wisps appear in forests after dark (in a day or few), drawn out by nearby pollution and player activity.
- Wisp detectors range can be set by R signal, see ingame description for more info.
- Lantern will-o-wisps last a long time, but you can always shoot them down (C key) if they're a bother.
- Mod only tracks surface darkness changes, not time, so mods that change day/night cycle should be compatible.


## Changes from the original mod

- 0.16.x compatibility update, various bugfixes.
- Mod Options menu settings for wisps/turrets aggression and spawning.
- Different spawning algorithm based on pollution.
- Rebalanced combat stats and material costs for technologies.
- Some new technologies (e.g. wisp lantern drones), some visual tweaks.
- Ingame changelog with full list of features, fixes and tweaks for each version.
