Makes days and nights 4x longer (by default) and multiplies accumulator capacities by the same value.
Factor is adjustable via Mod Settings menu, changing accumulators can be disabled there too.

Kinda like [Day Night Extender](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/DayNightExtender), but in 20 lines of lua instead of ~500, with proper Mod Settings affecting accumulator adjustments too, and compatible with 0.17.x.
