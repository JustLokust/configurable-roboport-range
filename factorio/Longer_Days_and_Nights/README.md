## Description

Makes days and nights 4x longer (by default) and multiplies accumulator capacities by the same value.
Factor is adjustable via Mod Settings menu (Startup tab), changing accumulators can be disabled there too.

Kinda like [Day Night Extender](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/DayNightExtender), but in 50 lines of lua instead of ~500, with proper Mod Settings affecting accumulator adjustments, and compatible with 0.17.x.

## Trivia

Whole default day/night cycle is ~7 minutes at 1x game speed, see [Factorio wiki Time page](https://wiki.factorio.com/Time) for nice visualization and more details. Also check out [Time Tools mod](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/binbinhfr/TimeTools) for an in-game clock, easy game speed controls and circuit network elements to track time-of-day on a weird alien worlds.

4x adjustment will stretch full 7m cycle into 28m, adjusting all phases of it proportionally.
This mod does not have options to affect specific phases differently (yet?).
