sentinel-alarm=Sentinel Alarm
sentinel-combinator=Sentinel Combinator

[item-description]
sentinel-alarm=Detects mobile biters within range specified by R signal (default is 32 tiles, <0 - disable scanning), sending signals defined on it to connected circuit network. Range signal (R) can be set on combinator itself, or supplied from the network.
sentinel-combinator=Detects mobile biters within range specified by R signal (default is 32 tiles, <0 - disable scanning), sending their numbers to connected circuit network. Range signal (R) can be set on combinator itself, or supplied from the network.

[mod-setting-description]
bds-signal-update-interval=Delay between updating *some* signals on Sentinel Combinators, in Game Ticks (60 ticks = 1 second at 1x speed). Full update of all combinators is done in interval * steps ticks, e.g. 12 * 10 = 120 ticks (every 2 seconds) by default.
bds-signal-update-steps=Steps for splitting update workload (default = 10). Can be increased to spread-out the scans between more game ticks, if e.g. many of these combinators are used with large scan areas.
bds-default-scan-range=Default range for scanning (in map tiles), if not overidden via circuit network signal. Default: 32 (1 map "chunk").
bds-max-scan-range=Limit on scanning range (in map tiles) to never go over. Mainly useful as a sanity-check in case circuit network signal setting the range gets bumped up to very high values. Default: 32 * 32 (32 map chunks).
bds-scan-other=Whether to detect Spawners, Worms and other non-unit enemy entities, grouped under "Other Aliens" signal. This uses different slower scanning method, reducing performance of the mod. Disabled by default.
