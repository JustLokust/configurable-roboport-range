## Description

Adds Sentinel Combinator, which can be placed near a Radar to detect number (and types) of biters in configurable radius (via R signal), transmitting that as signals for circuit network (red/green wires).

Combinator connects to closest radar within close range (8 tiles) and monitors the surrounding area centered on that radar when it is powered.
If radar is destroyed or scrapped, it picks new radar within range, if any.
Connected and working detector will always set at least "total" signal with 0 value on it, even if nothing is within range.

All units in "enemy" default force are detected, which should be biters, but not players or modded non-biter entities.
Each default mobile biter/spitter type emit their own signal, while any other entity within range is counted into "Other Alien Entities Count" signal, and "Total Alien Entities Count" counts them all.
Any other signals can be set on the combinator freely as well, it shouldn't touch them.

Detection radius (in tiles, default=32) can be set by R signal right on the combinator, or sent from the circuit network (added to local one if both are present).
Negative value can be sent to disable scanning (same as shutting down combinator or connected radar), or 0 to use default range.
Note that even with extremely high range set, detection should only work for map chunks that factorio simulates at the moment.

Mod settings allow to change update intervals and some workload parameters.

Can be built after unlocking Circuit Network technology, located next to Programmable Speaker on the crafting grid.
Has its own unique sprites. Uses biter icons from vanilla game for signals, with two special ones for "other" and "total" signals.


## Usage

Can be used to power defenses when biters are detected in the area, potentially in tiers, e.g. only enabling most expensive ones when detecting high numbers or heaver ones.

When connected to Programmable Speaker, can be used to broadcast an alert before buildings start getting destroyed, as biter hordes can be surprisingly sneaky in vanilla factorio.

    Very similar mod for 0.14 - 0.16. Might also work with modern factorio after minor modification.

    To have alerts on speakers be a bit more dramatic.
