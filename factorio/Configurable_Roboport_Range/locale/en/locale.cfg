[mod-setting-description]
range-multiplier=Multiplies both construction/logistics default or previously-modded ranges by this factor. Use 1 for no changes, >1 to increase, or e.g. 0.5 to reduce it. Result will be rounded to nearest integer value. Applied before range values below.
range-logistics=Logistics bot range of the roboport. Default/vanilla is 25. Special values: -1 - do not change it via this option, -2 - set to be equal to construction range. Applied after multiplier above and after static construction range value (if set).
