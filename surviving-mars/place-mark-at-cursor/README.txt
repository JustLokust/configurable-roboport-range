Adds Ctrl+<number> hotkeys to color hex tile where cursor points to.
Pressing color hotkey on the same hex removes it, Ctrl+0 removes all colored tiles.

Point is to highlight any kind of service-reach or future-placement hexes easily,
or just doodle on the map at your leisure while drones and colonists are hard at work.

List of drawing crayons:

- Ctrl+1 - [color=#e6194b]█[/color] Crimson [e6194b]
- Ctrl+2 - [color=#800000]█[/color] Maroon [800000]
- Ctrl+3 - [color=#4363d8]█[/color] Royal Blue [4363d8]
- Ctrl+4 - [color=#000075]█[/color] Navy Blue [000075]
- Ctrl+5 - [color=#3cb44b]█[/color] Chateau Green [3cb44b]
- Ctrl+6 - [color=#008080]█[/color] Teal [008080]
- Ctrl+7 - [color=#00ff00]█[/color] Green [00ff00]
- Ctrl+8 - [color=#000000]█[/color] Black [000000]
- Ctrl+9 - [color=#aaffc3]█[/color] Mint Green [aaffc3]
- Ctrl+0 - mass-eraser (careful, removes all paint marks on the map!)

They all look kinda neon too.
Keys can be redefined via the usual options menu.

Why these colors? - picked at random to be somewhat distinct.
Why hexes? - easier to mark game-related things with these.
Why paint? - placing stuff on plain ground within unmarked reach of multple things is hard.
Why Marx? - wanted to spell "❤ marks" but thought to shorten it a bit.

(protip: if mod gets out of date, Nexus version does not have lua_revision compatbility check,
but Mod Editor won't upload to Steam without it)
