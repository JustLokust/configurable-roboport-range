Adds Ctrl+<number> hotkeys to color hex tile where cursor points to.
Pressing color hotkey on the same hex removes it, Ctrl+0 removes all colored tiles.

Point is to highlight any kind of service-reach or future-placement hexes easily,
or just doodle on the map at your leisure while drones and colonists are hard at work.

They all look kinda neon too.
Keys can be redefined via the usual options menu.

Why these colors? - picked at random to be somewhat distinct.
Why hexes? - easier to mark game-related things with these.
Why paint? - placing stuff on plain ground within unmarked reach of multple things is hard.
Why Marx? - wanted to spell "‚ù§ marks" but thought to shorten it a bit.
